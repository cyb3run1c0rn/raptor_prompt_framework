## üöÄ Executive Summary

The **RAPTOR Prompt Engineering Framework** provides a structured and adaptable method for creating effective prompts for AI systems. It improves clarity, structure, and consistency, particularly for technical, professional, or high-stakes use cases.

**RAPTOR** stands for:

- **Role** ‚Äì Define the AI's persona  
- **Aim** ‚Äì Set a clear task  
- **Parameters** ‚Äì Apply scope and constraints  
- **Tone** ‚Äì Control communication style  
- **Output** ‚Äì Structure the response  
- **Review** ‚Äì Enable iteration or refinement  

This framework empowers users to guide AI models more effectively by scaffolding the prompt design process.

## üß† Role

Assigning a specific identity or area of expertise to the AI helps contextualise its knowledge and behaviour.

**Example:**  
> "You are a senior cybersecurity analyst with expertise in OT systems and incident response."

---

## üéØ Aim

Clearly articulate what you want the AI to accomplish.

**Example:**  
> "Analyse the key threats to critical infrastructure posed by emerging OT malware families in 2024."

---

## üìê Parameters

Define scope, exclusions, time frames, and other constraints.

**Example:**  
> "Focus on advisories from government agencies and known vendors since January 2024. Exclude generic ransomware."

---

## üéôÔ∏è Tone

Set the communication style to align with audience expectations.

**Example:**  
> "Use a formal and concise tone suitable for executive-level reporting."

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Output

Specify the desired structure or format of the response.

**Example:**  
> "Provide the analysis in four sections: (1) Key Vulnerabilities, (2) Attack Vectors, (3) Impact Assessment, (4) Mitigation Strategies."

---

## üîç Review

Encourage the AI to check for assumptions, missing data, or clarification needs.

**Example:**  
> "If assumptions are required, state them clearly. If information is missing, ask for clarification before continuing."

## üß© Use Cases

- Executive briefings  
- Technical risk reports  
- Educational content  
- Strategic planning with LLMs  
- Prompt libraries for consulting or SaaS

## ü¶Ö Super Powers with Meta Prompt?

1. Try the following meta prompt with your favourite chat llm (it tells the llm to use the RAPTOR Framework):

> "I want you to help me structure an effective AI prompt using the RAPTOR framework (Role, Aim, Parameters, Tone, Output, Review).
> 
> I will give you a brief description of what I need. From that, generate a full RAPTOR prompt that maximises clarity, structure, and control.
> 
> Please infer the appropriate Role, Aim, Parameters, Tone, Output structure, and Review instructions based on best practices.
> 
> Keep your response clear and professional.
> 
> Here is my idea or goal: **I want a fully built automatically generated web platform for predicting cardano progress. It should be a simple overview to allow for gaming trades**".

2. Use the output as the perfect prompt for your requirements.
