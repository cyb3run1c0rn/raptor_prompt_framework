## 🚀 Executive Summary

The **RAPTOR Prompt Engineering Framework** provides a structured and adaptable method for creating effective prompts for AI systems. It improves clarity, structure, and consistency, particularly for technical, professional, or high-stakes use cases.

**RAPTOR** stands for:

- **Role** – Define the AI's persona  
- **Aim** – Set a clear task  
- **Parameters** – Apply scope and constraints  
- **Tone** – Control communication style  
- **Output** – Structure the response  
- **Review** – Enable iteration or refinement  

This framework empowers users to guide AI models more effectively by scaffolding the prompt design process.

## 🧠 Role

Assigning a specific identity or area of expertise to the AI helps contextualise its knowledge and behaviour.

**Example:**  
> "You are a senior cybersecurity analyst with expertise in OT systems and incident response."

---

## 🎯 Aim

Clearly articulate what you want the AI to accomplish.

**Example:**  
> "Analyse the key threats to critical infrastructure posed by emerging OT malware families in 2024."

---

## 📐 Parameters

Define scope, exclusions, time frames, and other constraints.

**Example:**  
> "Focus on advisories from government agencies and known vendors since January 2024. Exclude generic ransomware."

---

## 🎙️ Tone

Set the communication style to align with audience expectations.

**Example:**  
> "Use a formal and concise tone suitable for executive-level reporting."

---

## 🗂️ Output

Specify the desired structure or format of the response.

**Example:**  
> "Provide the analysis in four sections: (1) Key Vulnerabilities, (2) Attack Vectors, (3) Impact Assessment, (4) Mitigation Strategies."

---

## 🔍 Review

Encourage the AI to check for assumptions, missing data, or clarification needs.

**Example:**  
> "If assumptions are required, state them clearly. If information is missing, ask for clarification before continuing."
