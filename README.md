## 🚀 Executive Summary

The **RAPTOR Prompt Engineering Framework** provides a structured and adaptable method for creating effective prompts for AI systems. It improves clarity, structure, and consistency, particularly for technical, professional, or high-stakes use cases.

**RAPTOR** stands for:

- **Role** – Define the AI's persona  
- **Aim** – Set a clear task  
- **Parameters** – Apply scope and constraints  
- **Tone** – Control communication style  
- **Output** – Structure the response  
- **Review** – Enable iteration or refinement  

This framework empowers users to guide AI models more effectively by scaffolding the prompt design process.

**Use as a Meta Prompt** - For near perfect prompt generation consider using as a meta prompt with your ideas or tasks.

## 🧠 Role

Assigning a specific identity or area of expertise to the AI helps contextualise its knowledge and behaviour.

**Example:**  
> "You are a senior cybersecurity analyst with expertise in OT systems and incident response."

---

## 🎯 Aim

Clearly articulate what you want the AI to accomplish.

**Example:**  
> "Analyse the key threats to critical infrastructure posed by emerging OT malware families in 2024."

---

## 📐 Parameters

Define scope, exclusions, time frames, and other constraints.

**Example:**  
> "Focus on advisories from government agencies and known vendors since January 2024. Exclude generic ransomware."

---

## 🎙️ Tone

Set the communication style to align with audience expectations.

**Example:**  
> "Use a formal and concise tone suitable for executive-level reporting."

---

## 🗂️ Output

Specify the desired structure or format of the response.

**Example:**  
> "Provide the analysis in four sections: (1) Key Vulnerabilities, (2) Attack Vectors, (3) Impact Assessment, (4) Mitigation Strategies."

---

## 🔍 Review

Encourage the AI to check for assumptions, missing data, or clarification needs.

**Example:**  
> "If assumptions are required, state them clearly. If information is missing, ask for clarification before continuing."

---

## 🧩 Use Cases

- Executive briefings  
- Technical risk reports  
- Educational content  
- Strategic planning with LLMs  
- Prompt libraries for consulting or SaaS

## 🛠️ Use the RAPTOR Meta Prompt Generator

Want to go beyond idea → prompt and reach **idea → working product**?

Use this RAPTOR **Meta Prompt Generator** to instruct the AI to build a complete, production-ready solution based on your concept—structured, scoped, and ready to deploy.

### 🧾 Meta Prompt Template:

> Help me generate a complete and production-ready AI prompt using the RAPTOR framework:  
> - Role  
> - Aim  
> - Parameters  
> - Tone  
> - Output  
> - Review  
>  
> I’ll describe my goal briefly—please expand it into a full RAPTOR prompt that will guide the AI to build the actual end product (e.g. a working app, tool, or system).  
>  
> My idea or task: **[INSERT YOUR IDEA HERE]**

---

### 💡 **Example Input 1.** Technical Application:

> My idea or task:  
> **Build a fully working web app that tracks Cardano blockchain activity and visualises key indicators to support gaming-based trading decisions. The final output should include source code, HTML/CSS/JS or Python (Flask), and setup instructions. The solution should be deployable by a non-technical user.**

---

### 🔄 Example Output Prompt (Generated by Meta Prompt):

> **Role:** You are a full-stack blockchain web developer with experience in building crypto dashboards.  
>
> **Aim:** Build a fully functional web application that visualises live Cardano blockchain metrics to support strategy decisions in gaming-related trading.  
>
> **Parameters:** Use publicly available data or mock data where API access is restricted. The app must include a dashboard interface, charts for key metrics (wallet activity, volume, NFT trades), and be deployable locally via Flask or Node.js. No database required. Ensure the front end is user-friendly.  
>
> **Tone:** Developer-friendly, using comments in code and straightforward language suitable for a junior developer or tech-savvy trader.  
>
> **Output:** Provide full working code for a Flask-based (or Node.js-based) web app, including:  
> 1. Setup instructions  
> 2. Frontend code (HTML/CSS/JS or React)  
> 3. Backend logic for data fetching/parsing  
> 4. Visualisation logic (e.g., Chart.js, D3)  
> 5. Notes for future API integration  
>
> **Review:** If any assumptions are unclear (e.g., type of Cardano data required or UI preferences), ask before proceeding. Confirm if a database or deployment target is needed (Heroku, Docker, etc.).

---

🔥 **Result:**  
This prompt, when pasted into ChatGPT (or Claude, or Gemini), can guide the AI to generate a **functioning MVP** of your idea — code and all.

---

### 💡 **Example Input 2.** (Non-Technical, Monetised Product):

> My idea or task:  
> **Create a complete downloadable product called “The Freelancer’s Proposal Pack” — a toolkit for freelance designers, writers, and developers that includes templates, pricing strategies, objection-handling scripts, and email outreach sequences. The final output should be packaged for sale on Gumroad or similar platforms.**

---

### 🔄 Example Output Prompt (Generated by Meta Prompt):

> **Role:** You are a creative business consultant and digital product strategist with experience helping freelancers productise their knowledge.  
>
> **Aim:** Develop a monetisable digital product titled “The Freelancer’s Proposal Pack” that provides ready-to-use templates and guidance for client pitching, pricing, and closing deals.  
>
> **Parameters:** The pack should serve freelance creatives (e.g. designers, writers, developers). Avoid agency-scale strategies—focus on solo operators and those starting out. Content must be editable (Google Docs or Notion-compatible). Ensure it's valuable enough to sell standalone or bundle into a course.  
>
> **Tone:** Practical, friendly, and empowering. Speak to freelancers who want to appear professional, close more deals, and protect their time without sounding too corporate.  
>
> **Output:** Generate the complete digital product, including:  
> 1. 3–5 proposal templates (with pricing examples)  
> 2. Email scripts for cold outreach, warm leads, and project follow-up  
> 3. A one-page pricing guide with value-based strategies  
> 4. Objection-handling cheat sheet (FAQ style)  
> 5. Bonus: A branded proposal document (editable in Google Docs or Notion)  
> 6. Simple PDF overview page with “how to use this pack” instructions  
>
> **Review:** Confirm if the product is targeted at a specific industry (e.g. tech, design, writing). Ask whether a light brand/style guide should be included. Check if the user would like a companion lead magnet for email list building.

---

🛍️ **Result:**  
Use this RAPTOR prompt in an AI assistant to create a **fully packaged, ready-to-sell freelance toolkit**—ideal for Gumroad, Etsy, Notion templates, or bundled into a coaching programme or digital course.
