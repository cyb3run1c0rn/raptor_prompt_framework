🚀 Executive Summary

The RAPTOR Prompt Engineering Framework offers a systematic and flexible approach to crafting effective prompts for AI systems. It enhances clarity, structure, and consistency, especially for technical, professional, or high-stakes scenarios.

RAPTOR stands for:
- Role – Define the AI’s persona
- Aim – Set a clear task
- Parameters – Establish scope and constraints
- Tone – Determine communication style
- Output – Specify the response format
- Review – Enable iteration or refinement

This framework helps users better guide AI models by providing a structured blueprint for prompt creation.

Use as a Meta Prompt – To achieve near-perfect prompt generation, consider utilising RAPTOR as a meta prompt alongside your ideas or tasks.

---

🧠 Role

Assigning a particular identity or area of expertise to the AI provides the correct context for its knowledge and behaviour.

Example:
"You are a senior cybersecurity analyst with expertise in OT systems and incident response."

---

🎯 Aim

Clearly state what you want the AI to accomplish.

Example:
"Analyse the key threats to critical infrastructure posed by emerging OT malware families in 2024."

---

📐 Parameters

Define the scope, exclusions, time frames, and any other limitations.

Example:
"Focus on advisories from government agencies and known vendors since January 2024. Exclude generic ransomware."

---

🎙️ Tone

Specify the desired communication style to suit the intended audience.

Example:
"Use a formal and concise tone suitable for executive-level reporting."

---

🗂️ Output

Instruct the AI on the exact structure or format of the response.

Example:
"Provide the analysis in four sections: (1) Key Vulnerabilities, (2) Attack Vectors, (3) Impact Assessment, (4) Mitigation Strategies."

---

🔍 Review

Prompt the AI to highlight assumptions, gaps in information, or any need for clarification.

Example:
"If assumptions are required, state them clearly. If information is missing, ask for clarification before continuing."

🧩 Use Cases

- Executive briefings
- Technical risk assessments
- Educational resources
- Strategic planning with LLMs
- Prompt libraries for consulting or SaaS

🛠️ Use the RAPTOR Meta Prompt Generator

Looking to go from idea → prompt to idea → working product?

Use this RAPTOR Meta Prompt Generator to instruct the AI to create a complete, production-ready solution—fully scoped, well-structured, and ready for deployment.

🧾 Meta Prompt Template:

Help me generate a complete and production-ready AI prompt using the RAPTOR framework:
- Role
- Aim
- Parameters
- Tone
- Output
- Review

I’ll describe my goal briefly—please expand it into a full RAPTOR prompt that will guide the AI to build the actual end product (e.g. a functional application, tool, or system).

My idea or task: [INSERT YOUR IDEA HERE]

💡 Example Input 1. (Technical Application)

My idea or task:
Build a fully working web app that tracks Cardano blockchain activity and visualises key indicators to aid gaming-based trading decisions. The final output should include source code, HTML/CSS/JS or Python (Flask), and setup instructions. The solution must be deployable by a non-technical user.

---

🔄 Example Output Prompt (Generated by the Meta Prompt)

Role: You are a full-stack blockchain web developer with experience in creating crypto dashboards.

Aim: Build a fully functional web application that visualises real-time Cardano blockchain metrics to support strategy decisions in gaming-related trading.

Parameters: Use publicly available data or mock data where API access is not feasible. The app should include a dashboard interface, charts for key metrics (wallet activity, volume, NFT trades), and be deployable locally via Flask or Node.js. A database is not required. The front end must be user-friendly.

Tone: Developer-friendly, with commented code and language accessible to a junior developer or tech-savvy trader.

Output: Provide fully working code for a Flask-based (or Node.js-based) web app, including:
1. Setup instructions
2. Front-end code (HTML/CSS/JS or React)
3. Back-end logic for data retrieval/processing
4. Visualisation elements (e.g., Chart.js, D3)
5. Notes on future API integration

Review: If assumptions are unclear (e.g., the specific Cardano metrics or UI design), ask before proceeding. Check whether a database or specific deployment platform (Heroku, Docker, etc.) is needed.

---

🔥 Result:
When used in ChatGPT (or Claude, Gemini, etc.), this prompt can guide the AI to produce a functioning MVP of your concept — complete with code.

---

💡 Example Input 2. (Non-Technical, Monetised Product)

My idea or task:
Create a complete downloadable product called “The Freelancer’s Proposal Pack” — a toolkit for freelance designers, writers, and developers that includes templates, pricing strategies, objection-handling scripts, and email outreach sequences. The final output should be prepared for sale on Gumroad or a similar platform.

---

🔄 Example Output Prompt (Generated by the Meta Prompt)

Role: You are a creative business consultant and digital product strategist experienced in helping freelancers package their services.

Aim: Develop a monetisable digital product called “The Freelancer’s Proposal Pack” that provides ready-to-use templates and guidance for pitching, pricing, and closing deals.

Parameters: The pack should cater to freelance creatives (e.g. designers, writers, developers). Avoid strategies suited for large agencies; focus on individuals or new freelancers. The content must be editable (Google Docs or Notion). Ensure the material is comprehensive enough to sell standalone or bundle with a course.

Tone: Practical, friendly, and encouraging. Address freelancers who aim to appear professional, secure more projects, and protect their time without sounding overly corporate.

Output: Produce the complete digital product, including:
1. 3–5 proposal templates with sample pricing
2. Email scripts for cold outreach, warm leads, and project follow-up
3. A concise pricing guide featuring value-based strategies
4. An objection-handling cheat sheet (FAQ style)
5. A branded proposal document (editable in Google Docs or Notion)
6. A short PDF explaining how to use the pack

Review: Confirm if the pack targets a specific niche (e.g. design, tech, writing). Ask whether a simple style guide is required. Check if the user would like to include a lead magnet for email list building.

---

🛍️ Result:
Use this RAPTOR-based prompt with an AI assistant to generate a complete, ready-to-sell freelance toolkit—ideal for Gumroad, Etsy, Notion templates, or to complement coaching programmes and digital courses.
