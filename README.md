## 🚀 Executive Summary

The **RAPTOR Prompt Engineering Framework** provides a structured and adaptable method for creating effective prompts for AI systems. It improves clarity, structure, and consistency, particularly for technical, professional, or high-stakes use cases.

**RAPTOR** stands for:

- **Role** – Define the AI's persona  
- **Aim** – Set a clear task  
- **Parameters** – Apply scope and constraints  
- **Tone** – Control communication style  
- **Output** – Structure the response  
- **Review** – Enable iteration or refinement  

This framework empowers users to guide AI models more effectively by scaffolding the prompt design process.

**Use as a Meta Prompt** - For near perfect prompt generation consider using as a meta prompt with your ideas or tasks.

## 🧠 Role

Assigning a specific identity or area of expertise to the AI helps contextualise its knowledge and behaviour.

**Example:**  
> "You are a senior cybersecurity analyst with expertise in OT systems and incident response."

---

## 🎯 Aim

Clearly articulate what you want the AI to accomplish.

**Example:**  
> "Analyse the key threats to critical infrastructure posed by emerging OT malware families in 2024."

---

## 📐 Parameters

Define scope, exclusions, time frames, and other constraints.

**Example:**  
> "Focus on advisories from government agencies and known vendors since January 2024. Exclude generic ransomware."

---

## 🎙️ Tone

Set the communication style to align with audience expectations.

**Example:**  
> "Use a formal and concise tone suitable for executive-level reporting."

---

## 🗂️ Output

Specify the desired structure or format of the response.

**Example:**  
> "Provide the analysis in four sections: (1) Key Vulnerabilities, (2) Attack Vectors, (3) Impact Assessment, (4) Mitigation Strategies."

---

## 🔍 Review

Encourage the AI to check for assumptions, missing data, or clarification needs.

**Example:**  
> "If assumptions are required, state them clearly. If information is missing, ask for clarification before continuing."

---

## 🧩 Use Cases

- Executive briefings  
- Technical risk reports  
- Educational content  
- Strategic planning with LLMs  
- Prompt libraries for consulting or SaaS

## 🛠️ Use the RAPTOR Meta Prompt Generator

Want to go beyond idea → prompt and reach **idea → working product**?

Use this RAPTOR **Meta Prompt Generator** to instruct the AI to build a complete, production-ready solution based on your concept—structured, scoped, and ready to deploy.

### 🧾 Meta Prompt Template:

> Help me generate a complete and production-ready AI prompt using the RAPTOR framework:  
> - Role  
> - Aim  
> - Parameters  
> - Tone  
> - Output  
> - Review  
>  
> I’ll describe my goal briefly—please expand it into a full RAPTOR prompt that will guide the AI to build the actual end product (e.g. a working app, tool, or system).  
>  
> My idea or task: **[INSERT YOUR IDEA HERE]**

---

### 💡 Example Input:

> My idea or task:  
> **Build a fully working web app that tracks Cardano blockchain activity and visualises key indicators to support gaming-based trading decisions. The final output should include source code, HTML/CSS/JS or Python (Flask), and setup instructions. The solution should be deployable by a non-technical user.**

---

### 🔄 Example Output Prompt (Generated by Meta Prompt):

> **Role:** You are a full-stack blockchain web developer with experience in building crypto dashboards.  
>
> **Aim:** Build a fully functional web application that visualises live Cardano blockchain metrics to support strategy decisions in gaming-related trading.  
>
> **Parameters:** Use publicly available data or mock data where API access is restricted. The app must include a dashboard interface, charts for key metrics (wallet activity, volume, NFT trades), and be deployable locally via Flask or Node.js. No database required. Ensure the front end is user-friendly.  
>
> **Tone:** Developer-friendly, using comments in code and straightforward language suitable for a junior developer or tech-savvy trader.  
>
> **Output:** Provide full working code for a Flask-based (or Node.js-based) web app, including:  
> 1. Setup instructions  
> 2. Frontend code (HTML/CSS/JS or React)  
> 3. Backend logic for data fetching/parsing  
> 4. Visualisation logic (e.g., Chart.js, D3)  
> 5. Notes for future API integration  
>
> **Review:** If any assumptions are unclear (e.g., type of Cardano data required or UI preferences), ask before proceeding. Confirm if a database or deployment target is needed (Heroku, Docker, etc.).

---

🔥 **Result:**  
This prompt, when pasted into ChatGPT (or Claude, or Gemini), can guide the AI to generate a **functioning MVP** of your idea — code and all.

---

### 💡 Example Input (Non-Technical):

> My idea or task:  
> **Create a complete training guide that teaches beginners how to write effective AI prompts using the RAPTOR framework. The final output should include lesson objectives, explanations, interactive exercises, and a downloadable workbook. It should be formatted for use in workshops or online learning platforms.**

---

### 🔄 Example Output Prompt (Generated by Meta Prompt):

> **Role:** You are an experienced AI trainer and instructional designer specialising in prompt engineering and LLM education.  
>
> **Aim:** Create a beginner-friendly training guide that introduces the RAPTOR prompt engineering framework and helps learners confidently apply it through practice.  
>
> **Parameters:** The content should be suitable for an audience with no prior experience in AI. Focus on practical understanding and clear, jargon-free language. Include interactive elements such as self-check questions or fill-in-the-blank RAPTOR templates. Format for use in both live workshops and self-paced e-learning modules.  
>
> **Tone:** Clear, supportive, and engaging. Avoid technical overload—use real-world analogies and approachable examples.  
>
> **Output:** Provide the complete training guide including:  
> 1. An overview of RAPTOR and its purpose  
> 2. Lesson objectives and outcomes  
> 3. Explanations of each RAPTOR component with examples  
> 4. Interactive exercises and reflection prompts  
> 5. A printable or downloadable PDF workbook  
> 6. Optional: Slide deck outline for instructors  
>
> **Review:** Confirm if this will be used online, in person, or both. Ask if branding, accessibility needs, or specific teaching tools (Google Slides, Notion, etc.) should be included. Flag if any core content is missing for a complete learning experience.

---

🎓 **Result:**  
When used with your favourite LLM, this prompt will produce a **structured, learner-friendly training product** you can immediately use in workshops, sell as a course, or integrate into an onboarding programme.
